# Whack-A-Mole

Whack-A-Mole is an engaging game where the objective is to score as many points as possible by 'whacking' moles that appear randomly on a grid within a limited time.

## How to Play

### Select Difficulty

- Choose your preferred difficulty level from Easy, Medium, or Hard. This setting adjusts the speed at which moles appear and disappear.
  - **Easy**: Moles appear at a slower pace, giving you more time to react.
  - **Medium**: A moderate challenge with quicker mole appearances.
  - **Hard**: Moles appear very rapidly for a true test of reflexes.

### Start the Game

- Click the **"Start Game"** button to begin.
- The timer will start counting down from 60 seconds.

### Whack the Moles

- Keep an eye on the grid of squares.
- When a mole pops up (indicated by a change in the square's appearance), quickly click on it to score a point.
- Be swift—the mole changes position based on the difficulty level you've selected.

### Track Your Score and Time

- Your current score is displayed on the screen.
- The remaining time is shown and counts down each second.

### Game Over

- The game ends when the timer reaches zero.
- An alert will display your final score.
- You can reset and play again to try to improve your score.

## Tips

- Stay focused on the entire grid, as moles appear randomly in any of the squares.
- The higher the difficulty, the faster the moles move—adjust your strategy accordingly.
- Practice to improve your reaction time and achieve a higher score.

Enjoy the game and see how many moles you can whack before time runs out!
